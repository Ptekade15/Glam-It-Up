                A body scrub is a specialist skincare formulation for skin exfoliation regimen i.e. it works to remove the dead cells, grime and sweat etc from its top layer, and reveal softer, smoother, and younger skin from underneath.

                A quality body scrub has cold-pressed botanical oils (Argan, Almond, Olive, etc), Botanical butters (Shea, Cocoa), natural exfoliating agents (strawberry seed powder, cocoa powder, walnut shell powder, etc), and other actives like clays, activated charcoal, essential oils, and glycerin etc.

                <h3>How Exfoliation helps improve skin</h3>
            </p>
            <div class="normal"></div>
                <p><strong>Skin brightening:</strong>  As the top layer of dead skin cells is removed through exfoliation, the newly revealed skin from underneath is fresher and brighter in appearance.</p>
                <p><strong>anti-aging:</strong>  Exfoliation boosts blood flow and helps boost stimulate under-skin collagen formation. As collagen is the key protein that gives the skin its firm and plumped up look, regular exfoliation is excellent to delay the onset of visible signs of aging on the skin.</p>
                <p><strong>smoothing: </strong>  Exfoliation with a good body scrub leaves the skin feeling so much smoother in look and feel. Regular exfoliation also helps soften extra dry and rough skin on elbows, knees, and ankles.</p> 
<p><strong>detoxification:</strong>  A scrub with activated charcoal powder helps detoxify skin by drawing out deep-seated toxins and dirt hidden in pores.</p>
<p><strong>Cellulite reduction:</strong> Scrubs with caffeine help with cellulite issues and can gradually help the dimpling go less prominent in colour and texture.</p>
<p><strong>Improves efficacy of skin serum/ cream:</strong>  Right after exfoliation, your skin is at its absorbent best. Whatever you apply topically will penetrate faster. Hence, your expensive body lotion or massage oil will be way more beneficial if applied after exfoliation.</p>
<p><strong>Relaxation:</strong> Body scrubbing or exfoliation means using massage like circular motions on skin. This is immensely relaxing and soothing for the mind.</p>
<p><strong>Hydration:</strong>   A quality body scrub has real cold-pressed botanical oils that help hydrate and nourishes the skin. This gives additional glow and suppleness to the skin.</p>
